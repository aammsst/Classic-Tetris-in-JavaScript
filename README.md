# Classic Tetris in JavaScript
A web app for playing Tetris, inspired in Nes' Tetris.

The colors are those of the 9th level in the game, it does have some bugs that I'm working on.

I'm a junior web developer trying to learn and apply new things, I also like playing classic tetris a lot.

Made for learning purpose, no copyright infractions intended.
